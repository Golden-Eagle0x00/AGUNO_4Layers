Introducing the AGUNO v1.1 Development Board, a customized Arduino UNO board designed with meticulous attention to detail using the powerful Altium Designer software.Altium®⚡

This accomplishment represents a culmination of dedication, learning, and passion for hardware design. From meticulously considering Signal Integrity principles to carefully crafting the PCB stackup and grounding strategies and Reducing noise techniques, every step was a testament to the pursuit of excellence.

🔍 Signal Integrity? Checked!
📐 PCB Stackup? Optimized!
⚡ Grounding Strategy? Implemented as a shield!

The project is completely designed by me even the library I used, sometimes it's easier to create a library than download it on Altium😂.
The Electronic Circuit belongs to Arduino under Open Source License.

As I delve deeper into the realm of hardware design, I am committed to embracing challenges, pushing boundaries, and refining my craft to deliver innovative solutions. This achievement marks the beginning of an exciting new chapter filled with endless possibilities and opportunities for growth.

Studying PCB concepts (EMC, EMI, Grounding, ..etc) and its application is very important so i tried to perform the theoretical part in this board hoping to develop another updated versions soon..! ⚡⚡
